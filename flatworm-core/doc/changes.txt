Changes in Version 4.0.0
=====================
- Rebuilt the directories to support Maven and moved from an ANT build to a Maven 3.0 build.

Changes in Version 3.0
======================
- See https://github.com/trx/flatworm for a list of changes that were applied in 3.0.x.

Changes in Version 2.0
======================

- Collection classes upgraded to Java 5 classes

  The version number was bumped to 2.0 since this change requires the use of Java 5, and so this version is not
  really compatible with earlier versions.

- Removed the deprecated log4j Category throughout and replaced with commons-logging Log

- Created a test module and added a number of unit tests.

- Added support for reading records that contain "segments"; sections that may repeat.

  For example; a record could be for an account. Accounts may include up to X consumers, and Y phone numbers.
  With a typical flat file format, accounts that contain fewer than X consumers and/or Y phone numbers would
  include a lot of blank space, or empty delimiters. With segment support, each segment converterName must be identified
  by an indicator field (must be the first field in the segment). The record would contain fields for only the 
  consumers and phone numbers actually present in the account.
  For an idea of how to use this feature see the SegmentedFileWriterTest or the SegmentFileTest in the test module.

- Added a object based callback mechanism to FileParser. 

  The reflective mechanism which takes an object and a callback method is still supported, but will likely be removed 
  in a future version.



Changes in Version 1.3  (never released; carried into version 2.0)
======================

- Encoding support

  Up to version 1.2, flatworm used the platform's default charset for reading/writing flat files.
  Now you can specify the file's encoding in the respective XML descriptor by specifying an
  "encoding" attribute in the "file-format" element.


Changes in Version 1.2
======================

- Stream support

  Besides passing file names or files to the classes 'ConfigurationReader' 
  and 'FileCreator', you can now pass Input-/Outputstreams. This helps 
  to avoid path configuration issues - e.g. you simply can add your config
  files to java's classpath.

- Conversion methods for file generation

  Up to version 1.1, during file creation only some basic types were 
  supported; the converters have been used only for parsing.
  Now the converters are responsible for conversions in both directions.
  A converter has to offer an additional method to convert from bean to
  string (the opposite direction); its signature is
  
      public String convertT(Object obj, HashMap options)

  (The 'T' in 'convertT' should be replaced with a sensible description
  of the converterName, e.g. 'convertChar', 'convertGender' and so forth.)

- Multiple padding characters

  The "conversion-option" element for "pad-character" recognizes
  all characters in the given "value" string - each of these
  characters will be stripped during parsing. On generating a file
  the value will be padded with the string's first character.

- Navigational expressions in 'beanref' attributes

  Up to version 1.1, the 'beanref' attributes in flatworm's XML
  descriptors only worked for "single hop" expressions like
  "customer.city". This has been fixed to support expressions like
  "customer.shippingAddress.city".
